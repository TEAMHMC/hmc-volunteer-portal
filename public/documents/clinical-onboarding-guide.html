<h2>1. Welcome &amp; Mission</h2>
<p>Welcome to Health Matters Clinic (HMC). As a Licensed Medical Professional volunteering with HMC, you play a vital role in providing free health screenings, wellness education, and community-based clinical services to underserved populations across Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>Our mission is to eliminate barriers to healthcare by meeting communities where they are. Your clinical expertise, combined with our operational infrastructure, enables us to deliver high-quality, culturally sensitive care at no cost to participants.</p>

<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
<h3>2.1 Clinical Governance</h3>
<p>HMC operates under a structured clinical governance model:</p>

  <li><strong>Licensed Medical Professionals</strong> &mdash; Volunteer physicians, nurses (RN/LVN), EMTs, paramedics, and allied health professionals who deliver direct patient care under standing orders</li>
  <li><strong>Core Volunteers</strong> &mdash; Non-clinical volunteers who support operations, logistics, and community engagement</li>
