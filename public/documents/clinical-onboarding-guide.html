<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 1: WELCOME & MISSION                             -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>1. Welcome &amp; Mission</h2>

<p>Welcome to Health Matters Clinic (HMC). As a licensed medical professional volunteering with HMC, you are joining a team that has served over 25,000 individuals since 2020 across Los Angeles County. This guide provides the governance framework, clinical protocols, and organizational policies you must understand before participating in any HMC clinical event.</p>

<h3>1.1 What HMC Is&mdash;and What It Is Not</h3>

<p>HMC is <strong>not</strong> a brick-and-mortar facility. All services are delivered through mobile, pop-up, and street medicine operations. We go <em>to</em> communities rather than waiting for them to come to us. Our clinical focus is prevention and early detection through the following service areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Health screenings (blood pressure, blood glucose, BMI, HIV/STI rapid testing, and others)</li>
  <li>Health education and coaching</li>
  <li>Navigation and warm handoffs to ongoing care</li>
</ul>

<p>HMC does <strong>not</strong> provide long-term treatment, prescribe medications, or function as an emergency department. Our role is to screen, educate, and connect participants to the care they need.</p>

<h3>1.2 Mission, Vision &amp; Values</h3>

<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To break down barriers to health&mdash;ensuring that everyone, regardless of background, has the opportunity to live their healthiest life.</p>

<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Nurturing Compassion, Transforming Lives.</p>

<p><strong>Core Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Respect for every person's dignity and autonomy</li>
  <li>Servant leadership in all interactions</li>
  <li>No shaming, stigma, or coercion</li>
  <li>Person-first language at all times</li>
  <li>Judgment-free spaces for every participant</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Service Philosophy</h3>

<p>HMC operates with a trauma-informed, culturally responsive, and equity-focused approach. All services are provided regardless of insurance status, immigration status, housing status, or ability to pay. Every clinical volunteer is expected to uphold these principles in every participant interaction.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Core principle:</strong> We meet people where they are&mdash;physically, emotionally, and culturally. Your role is to provide compassionate, non-judgmental care within the scope of HMC&rsquo;s approved screening and education services.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 2: CLINICAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE                 -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>2. Clinical Governance Structure</h2>

<h3>2.1 Supervising Practitioner (PA)</h3>

<p>The Supervising Practitioner (PA) serves as the clinical backbone of HMC. The PA holds responsibility for clinical oversight of all protocols, standing orders, and safety practices across the organization. The PA's core responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clinical oversight</strong> &mdash; Ensuring all clinical activities meet evidence-based standards</li>
  <li><strong>Primary clinical contact</strong> &mdash; Serving as the primary clinical authority during events</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol development</strong> &mdash; Authoring and maintaining all standing orders and clinical protocols</li>
  <li><strong>Team supervision</strong> &mdash; Directly supervising licensed staff during clinical operations</li>
  <li><strong>Escalation authority</strong> &mdash; Receiving and acting on all clinical escalations from the field</li>
</ul>

<p>The PA reports to the Executive Director and Board of Directors from a governance standpoint and may consult with MD/DO physicians for higher-level clinical review when indicated.</p>

<h3>2.2 Chain of Command</h3>

<p>HMC maintains a clear chain of command for all clinical operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Executive Director / Board of Directors</strong> &mdash; Organizational governance and strategic oversight</li>
  <li><strong>Supervising Practitioner (PA)</strong> &mdash; Clinical authority, protocol approval, and clinical decision-making</li>
  <li><strong>Licensed Staff (RN, LVN, EMT, MA)</strong> &mdash; Direct clinical services under PA supervision</li>
  <li><strong>Community Health Workers (CHWs), Volunteers &amp; Students</strong> &mdash; Supportive roles under licensed supervision per their scope</li>
</ol>

<div class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> If you encounter a clinical situation beyond your scope, immediately escalate to the lead clinician or Supervising Practitioner. The PA is your primary point of contact for any clinical question, concern, or uncertainty during an event.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 3: SCOPE OF PRACTICE                             -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>3. Scope of Practice</h2>

<h3>3.1 General Principles</h3>

<p>All clinical volunteers must operate within their licensed scope of practice as defined by the State of California. HMC does not expand or modify your scope of practice under any circumstances. You are expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide services only within your professional licensure and training</li>
  <li>Follow HMC standing orders for approved screening protocols</li>
  <li>Decline to perform any procedure you are not qualified or comfortable performing</li>
  <li>Maintain current, active licensure throughout your volunteer service</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Screenings Are Not Diagnoses</h3>

<p>A key principle governing all HMC clinical activities is that <strong>screenings are not diagnoses</strong>. All clinical volunteers must use standardized language when communicating results to participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;These are screenings, not a diagnosis.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Abnormal results mean you may need follow-up with a healthcare provider.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;You can decline any screening at any time.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning"><strong>Legal notice:</strong> Providing a diagnosis, prescribing treatment, or performing any clinical activity outside the scope of HMC&rsquo;s approved standing orders may void your liability coverage and expose you to personal legal risk. When in doubt, escalate to the Supervising Practitioner.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 4: CLINICAL EVENT TYPES                          -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>4. Clinical Event Types</h2>

<h3>4.1 Community Health Screenings</h3>
<p>Free health screenings conducted at community events, including blood pressure checks, blood glucose testing, BMI assessments, and health risk questionnaires. All screenings follow the General Screening Consent Form protocol and approved standing orders.</p>

<h3>4.2 Street Medicine Outreach</h3>
<p>Mobile clinical services delivered directly to individuals experiencing homelessness. Services include wound care, vital sign assessment, medication management support, and referrals to ongoing care. Street medicine requires completion of the Street Medicine training module prior to participation.</p>

<h3>4.3 Health Fairs</h3>
<p>Large-scale community wellness events with multiple screening stations, health education resources, and community partner organizations. Licensed professionals may oversee multiple stations and supervise unlicensed volunteers at these events.</p>

<h3>4.4 Wellness Education</h3>
<p>Community workshops on chronic disease management, nutrition, mental health awareness, and preventive care. Licensed professionals may serve as subject matter experts, presenters, or clinical advisors during educational programming.</p>

<h3>4.5 Service Areas &amp; Safety Considerations</h3>

<p>HMC operates across underserved areas of Los Angeles County, including South LA, East LA, Downtown, the San Fernando Valley, and other communities with limited access to healthcare. Some service locations&mdash;including Skid Row and encampment sites&mdash;require adherence to additional safety protocols:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Buddy system</strong> &mdash; No volunteer operates alone at high-risk locations</li>
  <li><strong>Naloxone on hand</strong> &mdash; Opioid reversal medication must be available at all street medicine events</li>
  <li><strong>Violence de-escalation</strong> &mdash; All team members at these sites must be trained in basic de-escalation techniques</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><strong>Safety first:</strong> Your personal safety is always the priority. If you feel unsafe at any time during an event, notify the event lead immediately. You are never required to remain in a situation you perceive as dangerous.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 5: STANDING ORDERS & SCREENING PROTOCOLS         -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>5. Standing Orders &amp; Screening Protocols</h2>

<h3>5.1 What Are Standing Orders?</h3>

<p>Standing orders are written clinical protocols authorized by the Supervising Practitioner (PA) that allow trained staff to perform specific screenings within defined limits. Standing orders do not take effect until the PA signs off on them, and they are reviewed annually or whenever clinical changes are needed.</p>

<h3>5.2 Current Standing Orders</h3>

<p>HMC maintains six major standing orders:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Blood Pressure Screening</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Blood Glucose &amp; HbA1c Screening</strong></li>
  <li><strong>HIV/STI Rapid Testing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Mental Health Screening</strong></li>
  <li><strong>BMI &amp; Basic Measurements</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Assessment</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>5.3 Standing Order Components</h3>

<p>Each standing order defines the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who can perform it</strong> &mdash; Required licensure level or role authorization</li>
  <li><strong>Required training</strong> &mdash; Specific competencies that must be completed before performing the screening</li>
  <li><strong>Equipment and procedure</strong> &mdash; Approved devices, supplies, and step-by-step protocol</li>
  <li><strong>Normal ranges</strong> &mdash; Reference values for interpreting screening results</li>
  <li><strong>Immediate PA notification triggers</strong> &mdash; Critical values requiring immediate escalation</li>
  <li><strong>Follow-up referral thresholds</strong> &mdash; Values indicating participant should be referred for further evaluation</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><strong>Refer to the HMC Standing Orders document (v3.0)</strong> for the complete text of all current standing orders. You must review the standing orders in full before participating in any clinical event.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 6: INFORMED CONSENT                              -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>6. Informed Consent</h2>

<h3>6.1 Consent Principles</h3>

<p>Every participant must understand what is being offered and has the right to decline any or all services. HMC&rsquo;s consent framework is built on four principles:</p>

<div class="policy-box">
  <h3>Consent Framework</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voluntary</strong> &mdash; Participation is entirely voluntary. No participant may be pressured, coerced, or incentivized to receive any screening or service.</li>
    <li><strong>Informed</strong> &mdash; The participant must receive a clear explanation of what the screening involves, what results may indicate, and how their information will be used.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocable</strong> &mdash; The participant may withdraw consent at any time, for any reason, without consequence.</li>
    <li><strong>Documented</strong> &mdash; Consent must be captured on the appropriate HMC consent form, signed by the participant (or legal guardian for minors), before any screening begins.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>6.2 HIV/STI Testing: Additional Requirements</h3>

<p>Under California law, HIV/STI rapid testing requires additional specific consent procedures beyond the General Screening Consent Form:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-test counseling must be provided, including an explanation of how the test works, what results mean, and confidentiality protections</li>
  <li>The participant must understand the meaning of a reactive result and the need for confirmatory testing</li>
  <li>A separate HIV testing consent must be documented</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.3 Language Access</h3>

<p>Consent forms are available in English and Spanish. For participants who speak other languages, interpreter services must be arranged. <strong>Never use a minor child as an interpreter for clinical discussions.</strong></p>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 7: ABNORMAL RESULTS & ESCALATION PROTOCOL        -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>7. Abnormal Results &amp; Escalation Protocol</h2>

<h3>7.1 Traffic-Light Escalation System</h3>

<p>HMC uses a traffic-light system to categorize screening results and determine the appropriate clinical response:</p>

<div class="policy-box">
  <h3>Result Classification &amp; Response</h3>
  <p><strong style="color: #16a34a;">GREEN &mdash; Normal Range</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Results within established normal parameters</li>
    <li>Provide education and encourage routine preventive care</li>
    <li>No escalation required</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong style="color: #f59e0b;">YELLOW &mdash; Abnormal, Needs Follow-Up</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Results outside normal range but not immediately life-threatening</li>
    <li>Escalate to the PA/Supervising Practitioner</li>
    <li>PA assesses and determines next steps: education with routine referral, urgent referral, or physician consult</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong style="color: #ef4444;">RED &mdash; Critical, Immediate Action Required</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Results indicating potential immediate danger to the participant</li>
    <li>Escalate to the PA/Supervising Practitioner immediately</li>
    <li>PA may activate EMS/911, initiate emergency protocols, or consult with MD/DO</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="warning"><strong>Mandatory escalation:</strong> ALL Yellow and Red results must be escalated to the PA/Supervising Practitioner. You may not independently determine that a Yellow or Red result does not require review. The PA assesses the situation and decides the appropriate course of action.</div>

<h3>7.2 PA Response Options</h3>

<p>Upon receiving an escalation, the Supervising Practitioner will assess the situation and select from the following response options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Education and routine referral to a primary care provider</li>
  <li>Urgent referral with expedited follow-up</li>
  <li>Consultation with an MD/DO for higher-level clinical review</li>
  <li>Activation of EMS/911 for life-threatening presentations</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 Red Flag 911 Triggers</h3>

<div class="critical"><strong>Call 911 immediately</strong> for the following presentations, regardless of whether the PA is available on-site:
<ul style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>Chest pain or signs of acute coronary syndrome</li>
  <li>Stroke symptoms (facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty)</li>
  <li>Severe hypoglycemia (unresponsive, seizure) or severe hyperglycemia with altered mental status</li>
  <li>Active suicidal ideation with a plan or means</li>
  <li>Severe allergic reaction / anaphylaxis</li>
</ul></div>

<h3>7.4 When the PA Is Not On-Site</h3>

<p>If the Supervising Practitioner is not physically present at the event, the following protocols apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phone consultation</strong> &mdash; Contact the PA by phone for clinical guidance</li>
  <li><strong>Backup licensed provider</strong> &mdash; Defer to the designated backup licensed provider on-site</li>
  <li><strong>911 for true emergencies</strong> &mdash; Do not delay emergency response while waiting for PA consultation</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.5 Participant Refusal of Emergency Care</h3>

<p>If a participant with critical results refuses emergency medical services:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Assess capacity</strong> &mdash; Determine whether the participant has decision-making capacity</li>
  <li><strong>Educate clearly</strong> &mdash; Explain the risks of refusing care in plain language</li>
  <li><strong>Document AMA refusal</strong> &mdash; Complete the Against Medical Advice (AMA) documentation, including the participant&rsquo;s stated reasons for refusal</li>
  <li><strong>Provide alternatives</strong> &mdash; Offer alternative resources and provide warning signs that should prompt the participant to seek emergency care</li>
</ol>

<div class="note"><strong>Remember:</strong> HMC events are NOT emergency departments. Our role in emergencies is to stabilize, support, and refer. Do not attempt to provide definitive emergency treatment beyond your scope and available resources.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 8: LIABILITY & INSURANCE COVERAGE                -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>8. Liability &amp; Insurance Coverage</h2>

<h3>8.1 HMC Insurance</h3>

<p>HMC carries general liability insurance and professional liability (malpractice) insurance covering clinical volunteer activities. Workers&rsquo; compensation coverage is provided for all team members, including volunteers, for injuries sustained during official HMC activities.</p>

<h3>8.2 When Coverage Applies</h3>

<div class="policy-box">
  <h3>Coverage Applies When You Are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Acting within your licensed scope of practice during an official HMC event</li>
    <li>Following approved HMC protocols and standing orders</li>
    <li>Operating under appropriate supervision as defined by the chain of command</li>
    <li>Documenting your clinical activities properly</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 16px; color: #ef4444;">Coverage May NOT Apply When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Acting outside your scope of practice or without authorization</li>
    <li>Providing clinical services at non-HMC events or locations</li>
    <li>Engaging in gross negligence or willful misconduct</li>
    <li>Failing to follow established HMC protocols or standing orders</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>8.3 Personal Professional Liability Insurance</h3>

<p>HMC strongly recommends that all licensed clinical volunteers maintain their own personal professional liability (malpractice) insurance as an additional layer of protection. HMC&rsquo;s organizational policy provides coverage for activities within its scope, but personal coverage offers an independent safeguard for the individual clinician.</p>

<div class="warning"><strong>Your best protection:</strong> Follow protocols. Document thoroughly. Obtain consent. Escalate appropriately. Consistent adherence to these four practices is the strongest defense against liability exposure.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 9: DOCUMENTATION & PRIVACY                       -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>9. Documentation &amp; Privacy</h2>

<h3>9.1 Current Documentation Framework (Phase 1)</h3>

<p>HMC is currently operating under Phase 1 of its data management plan. Under Phase 1, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do NOT store Protected Health Information (PHI) in non-HIPAA-compliant systems</strong> &mdash; This includes personal email, text messages, cloud drives, messaging apps, and any platform not approved by HMC</li>
  <li>De-identified or limited data sets may be used for program evaluation and reporting</li>
  <li>Paper forms containing PHI must be stored securely in a locked cabinet and transferred to the designated custodian at the conclusion of each event</li>
  <li>The focus of current data collection is population-level insights, not individual medical records</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 2 (planned): HMC will transition to a HIPAA-compliant electronic platform for fuller care coordination and longitudinal data management. Until Phase 2 is implemented, all PHI handling must follow Phase 1 restrictions.</p>

<h3>9.2 Documentation Requirements</h3>

<p>All clinical encounters must be documented. The following documentation is required:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SOAP notes</strong> &mdash; For all clinical assessments performed during events</li>
  <li><strong>Incident reports</strong> &mdash; For any emergencies, adverse events, injuries, or safety concerns (must be filed within 24 hours)</li>
  <li><strong>Escalation documentation</strong> &mdash; All escalations to the PA must be documented, including the reason for escalation, PA response, and outcome</li>
  <li><strong>Abnormal result records</strong> &mdash; All abnormal results, clinical decisions made, referrals provided, and participant responses must be recorded</li>
  <li><strong>Consent forms</strong> &mdash; Signed by participants before any screening or procedure</li>
  <li><strong>Shift sign-off</strong> &mdash; Completed at the end of each clinical shift via the volunteer portal</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.3 Confidentiality &amp; HIPAA</h3>

<p>HMC is committed to protecting participant privacy. All clinical volunteers must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain strict confidentiality of all participant health information</li>
  <li>Never discuss participant cases in public spaces, common areas, or on social media</li>
  <li>Secure all paper screening forms and transfer them to the designated custodian at the end of each event</li>
  <li>Report any suspected HIPAA breaches immediately to the event lead and organizational leadership</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning"><strong>Violation of HIPAA regulations may result in immediate removal from the volunteer program and potential legal consequences.</strong> This applies to both intentional disclosures and careless handling of participant information.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 10: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS                          -->

</ul>

<div class="critical"><strong>Naloxone protocol:</strong> All team members at street medicine events should know the location of naloxone and be trained in its administration. In the event of a suspected opioid overdose, administer naloxone, call 911, and begin rescue breathing or CPR as appropriate within your scope.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 11: INFECTION CONTROL & SAFETY                   -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>11. Infection Control &amp; Safety</h2>

<h3>11.1 Standard Precautions</h3>

<p>Standard precautions must be observed for all participant encounters, regardless of the participant&rsquo;s known or suspected health status. All clinical volunteers must adhere to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hand hygiene</strong> &mdash; Perform hand hygiene before and after every participant contact, using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
  <li><strong>PPE</strong> &mdash; Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, masks, eye protection) as indicated by the clinical activity. Dispose of single-use PPE properly after each participant encounter</li>
  <li><strong>Sharps handling</strong> &mdash; Place all sharps in FDA-approved sharps containers <em>immediately</em> after use. <strong>Never recap needles.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Biohazard disposal</strong> &mdash; Dispose of all biohazard materials (blood-contaminated items, used test kits, soiled gauze) in designated biohazard waste containers</li>
  <li><strong>OSHA compliance</strong> &mdash; All clinical activities must comply with OSHA bloodborne pathogen standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.2 Exposure Incidents</h3>

<p>In the event of a needlestick injury or other exposure incident:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wash the affected area immediately with soap and water (for mucous membrane exposure, flush with water)</li>
  <li>Report the incident to the event lead immediately</li>
  <li>Complete an incident report</li>
  <li>Seek post-exposure evaluation and follow-up per applicable guidelines</li>
</ol>

<div class="critical"><strong>Immediate reporting required:</strong> All needlestick injuries, blood or bodily fluid exposures, and other occupational exposure incidents must be reported immediately. Do not wait until the end of the event to report an exposure.</div>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<!-- SECTION 12: CREDENTIALING & COMPLIANCE                   -->
<!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>12. Credentialing &amp; Compliance</h2>

<p>To maintain active clinical volunteer status with HMC, you must satisfy the following requirements on an ongoing basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>License currency</strong> &mdash; Keep your professional license current and active. Report any changes to your licensure status (suspension, restriction, lapse, or disciplinary action) within 72 hours</li>
  <li><strong>Portal documentation</strong> &mdash; Upload your current license, DEA registration (if applicable), and malpractice insurance documentation to the volunteer portal. Keep these documents current in the system</li>
